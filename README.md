# Gold-Loan-Prediction-by-machine-learning-Random-forest

Gold is  one of  the critical commodities  that  is used  as a barometer of  economic activity prevailing in  the globalized world. The price  of the gold is  dependent on many economic indicators and is complex to understand the dynamics of its price discovery. To predict the prices  of gold  is paramount  for  any  business  involved in  global trade  and in  turn  gives indications of the overall financial stability of the global business environment. In this project, a system which is based on machine learning algorithms to predict the gold prices based on the historical data related to other closely related commodities and stock market indicators. The system is based on Random Forest Regression algorithm which is used to train on historical commodity prices such as Crude oil, Silver Price, Stock Price which are key indicators  of  the  global  financial  markets  and  forms  the  core  decision  logic  for  future predictions. The results prove that the Random Forest Regressor Machine learning Algorithm performs better than the other methods with a forecasting accuracy of 98%.

# A Brief about Random Forest Regression-
A simple yet crisp definition, to understand what Random Forest Regression Algorithm is, will be, “Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. It operates by constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean of the classes as the prediction of all the trees“

The flow-chart depicting Random Forest Algorithm is shown below-
